title: Resource list for the succesful Javascript beginner
---

<div class="message">
  Howdy! This is an example blog post that shows several types of HTML content supported in this theme.

Learning a new programming language can be overwhelming. In the case of Javascript, there is a tremendous amount of blogs, articles written about every single aspect of it. Not all content is good. There are a lot of ways to dive head first into this content. When I started learning the language I trusted upon some less than stellar websites. (Steady but slowly ) I have amassed a list of excellent resources, a list I would have wanted when first starting to learn Javascript. It would have saved me a tremedous amount of time.

Instead of learning the right things, I made these mistakes:
- Dive head first into JQuery without having a basic understanding of javascript
- Not learning about the more dry CS topics: data structures, algorithms. You might think you don’t need this knowledge for building a great product, you might be right. Indirectly it will hinder you in writing concise, elegant code resulting in fewer lines of code, fewer errors, less time debugging,...

##Eloquent javascript
A free online book intended for beginners (chapters 1 - 4). Starting from chapter 5 the difficulty rises, but is managable for beginners and intermediate codes alike.

##Codeschool 
Walks you through the basic concepts of the language by making you complete levels and collect points for your correct solutions. A fun gamification approach to coding.

##MDN Mozilla 
The best documentation out there on Javascript. Everythimg from the very [basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_Types) to the most [difficult concepts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) are covered

##JS Bin
Start writing your own code while you are going through the above resources by playing around in an online javascript environment. Enable the Javascript and Console pane and start coding!

##The Command Line Crash Course
The terminal can be a scary place. You might fuck up you whole computer. You might also speed up your coding workflow by a tenfold. Follow these small lessons as a forceful way to break through your fear of the Terminal.

##GitImmersion
Once you are confident enough in a terminal window it’s time for you to learn git. It looks scary and it can be just that. Everybody struggles with it, it’s comforting you are not alone in this struggle. It is good to learn git even when you are working solo. It will allow you to store multiple versions of your project. This way you can explore multiple ideas at once without ruining all your previous code.
