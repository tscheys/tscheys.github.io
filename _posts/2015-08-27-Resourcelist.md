title: A Learning Repository for the Succesful Javascript Beginner
---

Learning Javacript can be overwhelming. To make matters worse, **the majority of the content you will find is not up to par**. I used to rely on such resources a lot. Therefore I provide you, *the novice* with a list. A list I wish I had when first starting out.

Instead of learning the thing on this list, **I made these mistakes**:

+ Diving head first into JQuery without having a basic understanding of Javascript itself.
+ Not learning about the more dry CS topics: data structures, algorithms. (Hint: These concepts will indirectly        help you write better code)

##Eloquent javascript
A free online book intended for beginners (chapters 1 - 4). From chapter 5 and on, the difficulty rises, but is managable for beginners and intermediate codes alike. 
[Start reading the book here](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)

##Codecademy
Walks you through the basic concepts of the language by making you complete levels and collect points for your correct solutions. A fun gamification approach to coding. 
[Play some levels learning code here](https://www.codecademy.com/)

##MDN Mozilla 
The best documentation out there on Javascript. Everything from the very [basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_Types) to the most [difficult concepts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) are covered.

##Devdocs 
Ideal if you are looking at different documentation websites for a project. Devdocs bundles all documentation in one place.

##JS Bin
Start writing your own code while you are going through the above resources by playing around in an online javascript environment. Enable the Javascript and Console pane and start coding!

##The Command Line Crash Course
The terminal can be a scary place. You might fuck up you whole computer. You might also speed up your coding workflow by a tenfold. Follow these small lessons as a forceful way to break through your fear of the Terminal.

##GitImmersion
Once you are confident enough in a terminal window it’s time for you to learn git. It looks scary and it can be just that. Everybody struggles with it, it’s comforting you are not alone in this struggle. It is good to learn git even when you are working solo. It will allow you to store multiple versions of your project. This way you can explore multiple ideas at once without ruining all your previous code.
